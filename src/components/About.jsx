        Hi, I’m <b>Michael Angelo Soreta</b>, a <b>Cum Laude</b> graduate with a{" "}
        <b>Bachelor's in Computer Science</b> from the{" "}
        <b>Technological University of the Philippines</b>. As a{" "}
        <b>fresh graduate</b>, I specialize in building responsive,
        user-friendly websites using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>,
        and <b>React</b>. I’m currently expanding my skills to become a
        Full-Stack Developer. I’m passionate about everything I do—especially
        solving problems and continually learning new technologies to refine my
        craft. Outside of coding, you’ll find me at the gym or on the basketball
        court.
